In Spring, you can use init-method and destroy-method as attribute in bean configuration file for bean to perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction. Alternative to InitializingBean and DisposableBean interface.

The ConfigurableApplicationContext.close will close the application context, releasing all resources and destroying all cached singleton beans.

Output

Init method after properties are set : i'm property message
com.mkyong.customer.services.CustomerService@47393f
...
INFO: Destroying singletons in org.springframework.beans.factory.
support.DefaultListableBeanFactory@77158a:
defining beans [customerService]; root of factory hierarchy
Spring Container is destroy! Customer clean up

The initIt() method is called, after the message property is set, and the cleanUp() method is called after the context.close();
Thoughts…
It’s always recommended to use init-method and destroy-method in bean configuration file, instead of implement the InitializingBean and DisposableBean interface to cause unnecessarily coupled your code to Spring.
